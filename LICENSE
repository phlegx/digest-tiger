  These are based on the reference implementation found on the
  official website (http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/),
  which reads:

    Tiger has no usage restrictions nor patents. It can be used
    freely, with the reference implementation, with other
    implementations or with a modification to the reference
    implementation (as long as it still implements Tiger). We only ask
    you to let us know about your implementation and to cite the
    origin of Tiger and of the reference implementation.
